These are DAn Halpern's changes to Jim Fox's excellent uwthesis.cls file and
accompanying document source. Now that UW has gone to electronic-only
submission, we should really be using the hyperref package to produce better
electronic documents.

Adding this package broke a bunch of things in Jim's version, which I fix here.

This version is licensed under the APACHE-2.0 License as is Jim's original
version. See the uwthesis.cls or uwthesis.tex file. Go to Jim's website:

Jim's original README begins here:

This is source and documentation for the latex thesis package
at the University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.

The tex file is both a thesis template and the documentation,

uwthesis.cls	The class file
uwthesis.tex	Documentation and example
uwthesis.bib	Bibliography for the documentation
uwthesis.pdf	Preformatted uwthesis document
